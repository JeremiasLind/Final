            <article class="productp1">The blazepod is an invention wich is supposed to increase the reflexs of people in combination with a workout. It can be used in infinite amount of ways, only being limited by creativity. It can be used for basically all sports, and therefore will be helpful for each sport sector</article>
            <article class="productp2">This innovation is all about speed. In combination with the app it is possible to collect all the data which is beign generated. For example how long it takes for an athlete to reach a button and press it. This can help organize and create efficient workouts.</article>
            <article class="productp3">This innovation is easy to use. All you need is to set up the app on a device, link the pods and done! now with the software you are able to create any excersise you want, ranging from full body workouts to cardio runs, whatever suits you best.</article>
            <article class="productp4">Due to its rediculously high price, the blazepod has yet to reach the masses, however high tier athletes have been spotted using them. This includes F1 racers such as Lando Norris, F1 being a sport where reflexes and timing is the key to success.</article>
            <article class="productp5">Blazepod is expected to make this profitable tool more open to the masses. The high innitial cost and added running cost for the software makes it impossible for everyday people to afford such a device, therefore we are expecting/hoping for a cheaper version,</article>
            <article class="productp6">As stated, the future of this product is looking rather bad if it stays this unnafordable. Blazepods will saturate the professional market, and then it will have to move on to the non-proffesional market, meaning it will have to create a cheaper product for personal buyers</article>
